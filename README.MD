# My Bike List Website

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is focus on building a REST API website to practice and learn new technologies.

## Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first steps in the development of the projects were to setup the the Spring Boot environment in my pc. Afterward, I start creating the Model, Implementation, Service and Controller files. Then, I had to setup the Database in MySQL and create the table. When finish with the DB, I started testing the HTTP calls. The test was succesful so I started with the development of the client side by setting up the Angular environment and then started building the Model, Interface, Service and Components. Finally, I finished the project with every functionality working correctly.
